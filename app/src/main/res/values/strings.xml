    <string name="order">The Green &amp; Blue Space provides the opportunity to order veg bags that contain seasonal and locally sourced veg. You can now order them via this app in the \“Order Veg Bag\” section.\n
                \n
                Times\nFor each week orders are only accepted on Mondays and Tuesdays until 5pm. Out of these times you will not be able to make an order.\n
                If you have successfully made an order, you can pick up your veg bag on Thursday from 11:00 until 4:30pm in The Green &amp; Blue Space, which is located in the Atrium towards the bridge exit.\n
                \n
                Field explanations\nWhen making an order, choose the number of bags you would like to order (normally this would be 1, but in case you are ordering for a friend or hosting a huge dinner party, other options are available). Please also indicate if you would like to order any extras* or if you have any allergies (e.g. beetroot). Finally, leave a comment if you wish and click Submit. This will automatically generate the email for you and you’ll just have to click send from your email app.\n
                \n*Extras - additionally you can order eggs (£1.75 for 6 eggs) and also extra vegetable (e.g. sweet potatoes, leeks etc.) \n
                \n
                Pricing\nThe cost of one vegetable bag is £6.50.\nA box of 6 eggs costs £1.75.\nPrices for other extras vary, as these come from wholesale and the price is known only when the food arrives.
